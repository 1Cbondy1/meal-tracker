## Nibble Note
Keeping track of your child’s meals shouldn’t be a guessing game. This app offers a playful, animated interface that makes logging daily meals simple and engaging. The main screen updates in real time to showcase the most recent entry in a stylized visual canvas, while a scrollable side panel keeps a clear, organized history of past meals at your fingertips.

## Instructions:
- Ensure you have the following installed on your system: Docker, Node.js, & npm (app was built using node v22.14 and npm v11.3)
- Create an .env file at the project root directory and add the lines:
`REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001`
`REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:3001`
- From the project root, start up your services using the command: `docker-compose up --build`
- You should now be able to view the app at `http://localhost:3000`
